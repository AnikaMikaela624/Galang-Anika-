        <h2>Hi my name is Anika Galang</h2>

        <p> I never really liked any sports when I was young but when my parents enrolled me for swimming I got really nervous because I didn’t know how to. My first training came  and it was really fun. After that I fell inlove with swimming. I didn’t continue it to advance because it was expensive. When I heard that there was sports training in Perpetual I instantly enrolled. Because of that I eventually joined my very first competition in UP diliman and I was really excited. The competition ended and I went home happy because I went home with 4 medals in total in all events. </p>

        

        <h3>The medals I went home with</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>25 Meter butterfly – silver medal🥈</li>

            <li>25 Meter backstroke – bronze medal🥉</li>

            <li>25 Meter breaststroke – silver medal🥈</li>

            <li>25 Meter freestyle – gold medal🥇</li>

        </ul>
